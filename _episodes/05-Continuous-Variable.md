## Comparison of two sample groups

Earlier we discussed continuous data, and how to investigate relationships
(correlations) between two continuous variables. In this section, we will learn
how to identify whether a single continuous trait differs between two sample
groups - a two sample test. Specifically, we will investigate whether there is a
statistically-significant difference between the distribution of that variable
between the two groups. As an example, we will test whether male patients in our
tuberculosis study are taller than female patients.

### Choosing the relevant test

As with testing for categorical variables, there are a range of different
statistical analyses for two sample group comparisons; the appropriate one to
use is determined by the nature of the dataset. There are two primary questions
we need to ask to identify the relevant test: are the two datasets
normally-distributed, and are the data paired (that is, are there repeated
measurements on the same samples)? The figure below summarises the choice of
statistical test used for each of these cases.

![RStudio layout](../fig/05-fig1.png)

The first step is to determine whether the continuous variable in each group is
normally distributed. We've already learned about the `shapiro.test` function to
test for normality, and can use that again in this situation.

The second decision is to identify whether the data is paired or not. Paired
data is when the two groups are the same test samples but measured under
different conditions (for example, a group of patients tested before and after
treatment), unpaired is when the two groups are independent (for example, two
separate groups of patients, one group treated and one untreated).

There are a few further subtleties beyond this which we will come to in a
moment, but these are the two major determining factors in choosing the correct
test.

## Two sample Student's T-test

If data is normally distributed for **both** groups, we will generally use the
Student's T-test. This compares the means of two groups measured on the same
continuous variable. Tests can be two-sided (testing whether the groups are not
equal) or one-sided (testing either whether the second group is greater than or
less that the first). As we discussed in the introduction, generally a two-sided
test is preferred unless there is a specific reason why a single-sided one is
justified.

H<sub>0</sub>: µ<sub>1</sub> = µ<sub>2</sub> | against | H<sub>1</sub>:
µ<sub>1</sub> ≠ µ<sub>2</sub> (two-sided)
 | or |
H<sub>0</sub>: µ<sub>1</sub> <= µ<sub>2</sub> | against | H<sub>1</sub>:
µ<sub>1</sub> > µ<sub>2</sub> (greater)
 | or |
H<sub>0</sub>: µ<sub>1</sub> >= µ<sub>2</sub> | against | H<sub>1</sub>:
µ<sub>1</sub> < µ<sub>2</sub> (less)

If **equal variance**: Student's T-test
If **unequal variance**: Welch's two-sample T-test
If **data are paired**: Student's paired T-test

> ## Tip
> The R `t.test` function combines all three of these tests, and defaults to
> Welch's two-sample T-test. To perform a standard T-test, use the parameter
> setting `var.equal = TRUE`, and for a paired T-test, use `paired = TRUE`.

## Two sample Mann-Whitney test

Unless **both** groups are normally distributed, use the Mann-Whitney test. This
is a non-parametric test analogous to the unpaired T-test, used when the
_dependent_ variable is non-normally distributed

The Mann-Whitney test compares the medians of the two groups rather than the
means, by considering the data as rank order values rather than absolute values.

> The `wilcox.test` function in R defaults to unpaired data - effectively
> returning the Mann-Whitney test instead. Carry out a paired Wilcox test with
> the `paired = TRUE` argument

## Two sample test example

Is there a difference in height between females and males in the tuberculosis
dataset?

Height: Continuous variable
Gender: Categorical variable with two levels
Null hypothesis: There is no difference in height between the groups

_Step one - visualise the data_
We will start by reviewing the data using a boxplot to see if there is an
indication of difference between the groups

```r
plot(tuberculosis$Height ~ tuberculosis$Gender,
     col=c('red','blue'),
     ylab = 'Height',
     xlab = 'Gender')
```
![RStudio layout](../fig/05-fig2.png)

Visually there certainly appears to be a difference. But is it statistically
significant?

_Step two - is the data normally distributed?_

```r
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(tuberculosis$Height[which(tuberculosis$Gender == 'F')], main = "Histogram of heights of females", xlab = "")
hist(tuberculosis$Height[which(tuberculosis$Gender == 'M')], main = "Histogram of heights of males", xlab = "")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
![RStudio layout](../fig/05-fig3.png)

This doesn't look very normally-distributed, but we do have relatively few data
points. A more convincing way to determine this would be with the Shapiro-Wilks
test

```r
by(tuberculosis$Height, tuberculosis$Gender, shapiro.test)
```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Gender: F
##
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
##
## data:  dd[x, ]
## W = 0.94142, p-value = 0.2324
##
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Gender: M
##
## 	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
##
## data:  dd[x, ]
## W = 0.88703, p-value = 0.05001
~~~
{: .output}

Neither test gives a significant p-value, so in the absence of sufficient
evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of non-normality, we treat the
data as if it were normal; that is, we use a T-test

_Step three - are variances equal?_

```r
# A quick and dirty test - how similar are the standard deviations?
by(tuberculosis$Height, tuberculosis$Gender, sd)
```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Gender: F
## [1] 5.518799
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Gender: M
## [1] 9.993331
~~~
{: .output}

```r
# Or properly test for equality of variance using Levene's test
library(DescTools)
```

~~~
## Registered S3 method overwritten by 'DescTools':
##   method         from
##   reorder.factor gdata
~~~
{: .output}

```r
LeveneTest(tuberculosis$Height ~ tuberculosis$Gender)
```

~~~
## Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)
##       Df F value  Pr(>F)
## group  1  3.4596 0.07131 .
##       35
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
~~~
{: .output}

Although the standard deviations of the two groups (and hence the variances)
seem to be quite different, Levene's test gives a non-significant p-value of 0.07.
This means that we shouldn't reject the null hypothesis of equal variance, and
so we should perform a Student's T-test. If the variances had been different,
then we would have used Welch's two-sample T-test instead.

_Step four - carry out a T-test_

```r
# Specify equal variance using the var.equal = TRUE argument.
# var.equal would be set to FALSE if the p-value of the Levene's test was less
# than 0.05, and the `t.test` function would then run a Welch's two-sample test.
t.test(tuberculosis$Height ~ tuberculosis$Gender, var.equal = TRUE)
```

~~~
##
## 	Two Sample t-test
##
## data:  tuberculosis$Height by tuberculosis$Gender
## t = -3.6619, df = 35, p-value = 0.00082
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -14.655702  -4.201441
## sample estimates:
## mean in group F mean in group M
##        160.5714        170.0000
~~~
{: .output}

**Conclusion**: the p-value is significant so we can accept the alternative
hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference in the mean height of males
and females in our dataset.

## Group descriptions

If there is a significant difference between the two groups (or even if there
isn't) it is often useful to generate some summary statistics for each group.
We can do this with the `by` command, which we've used already in this section,
combined with summary functions


```r
# For normally distributed data, report the mean and standard deviation
by(tuberculosis$Height, tuberculosis$Gender, mean)
```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Gender: F
## [1] 160.5714
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Gender: M
## [1] 170
~~~
{: .output}

```r
by(tuberculosis$Height, tuberculosis$Gender, sd)
```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Gender: F
## [1] 5.518799
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Gender: M
## [1] 9.993331
~~~
{: .output}

```r
# For non-normally distributed data, report the median and inter-quartile range
by(tuberculosis$Duration, tuberculosis$Rec, median)
```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Rec: NoRecurrence
## [1] 8
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Rec: Recurrence
## [1] 11
~~~
{: .output}

```r

```

~~~
## tuberculosis$Rec: NoRecurrence
## [1] 6
## ------------------------------------------------------------
## tuberculosis$Rec: Recurrence
## [1] 6.75
~~~
{: .output}

```r
# Many of the summary statistics can be calculated in one step with the FSA
# Summarize function
library(FSA)
Summarize(tuberculosis$Height~tuberculosis$Gender)
```

## Paired samples
If data is paired, that is, it is the same samples under two different
conditions, we can take advantage of that to carry out statistical tests with
greater discriminatory power. That is because by using paired samples, we remove
a lot of the noise that can otherwise obscure our results. Paired data must have
the same number of results in each group, there must be a one-to-one relationship
between the groups (every sample that appears in one group must appear in the
other), and the data must be the same sample order in each group.

Otherwise, paired sample analysis is performed in a similar way to unpaired
analysis. The main difference is to add the `paired = TRUE` argument to the
`t.test` or `wilcox.test` function.
