## Previewing data

Prior to uploading any dataset into R for analysis, it is useful to review the 
contents of that file to understand the structure of the data. This will allow
you to choose the best data structure for your dataset, and will identify the 
relevant command and settings you need when uploading the data to R. 

For small files, like the one we are using today, this review can be done with a
simple text editor, either an app on your computer or from within RStudio. For 
very large datasets this is not advisable - files may take a very long time to 
open and may even crash your computer. Such large files may have documentation 
explaining their format, or you may need to use the `head` function to look at 
just the first part of the file.

Today we will be working with a datafile containing dummy data representing prison
inmates diagnosed with tuberculosis. In this dataset, we are considering the effect
various factors have on the time to recovery when treated with either a single or a 
combination of antibiotics.

> ## Challenge 1
> 
> Use RStudio “Files” window, your text editor of choice, or a spreadsheet 
> program to open and review the data file _tuberculosis.csv_ (do not overwrite 
> the file by saving afterwards). Consider the meaning of the headers and what
> the nature of the data in each column might be; perhaps discuss with your 
> neighbour if you are in an in-person session. How many patient records are 
> there in the dataset?
> > ## Solution to challenge 1
> > 
> > The field contents are as follows:
> > * Patient_ID – a unique numerical identifier for each patient
> > * Gender – female or male: one-letter character string
> > * Age – patient’s age: numerical value in years
> > * Height – patient’s height: numerical value in (probably) cm
> > * Weight – patient’s weight: numerical value in (probably) kg
> > * BMI – patient’s body mass index (weight/height in m<sup>2</sup>)
> > * Obese – is the patient obese (BMI>30): 0=no, 1=yes;
> > * Smoking.Status – does the patient smoke: 1=non-smoker, 2=smoker; 
> > * Alcohol.Consumption – does the patient drink alcohol: 1=no, 2=previously,
> > 3=currently; 
> > * Treatment – did the patient receive the multi-drug treatment: 
> > 0=single antibiotic, 1=multiple antibiotic; 
> > * Rec – did disease recur: 0=no recurrence, 1=recurrence; 
> > * ExtraPul – did the patient have extrapulmonary infection: 0=no, 1=yes;
> > * Duration – duration of antibiotic treatment: months
> > * Term – term of imprisonment prior to diagnosis: months
> > 
> > There are a total of 37 patient records in this file

## Importing data

Once you've reviewed the contents of the data file, you can decide how best to
upload it into R. In this case, we have a tabular layout with fields separated
by commas - a CSV file - so we will use the `read.csv` function to import this
dataset.

> ## Tip
> When reading in tabular data in R, you can use either `read.table` or a range
> of pre-configured aliases: `read.csv`, `read.csv2`, `read.delim` and
> `read.delim2`. These have function arguments already set to correspond to a
> range of different formats of CSV (comma separated value) and TSV (tab
> separated value) files.

```r
# The default settings of `read.csv` differ between R versions, so when running
# the command, we need to specify the stringsAsFactors parameter
tuberculosis <- read.csv("data/tuberculosis.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

Now the file is uploaded, you can find out more about this dataset using the
`head`, `str`, and `summary` functions.

```r
head(tuberculosis)
```

## Columns as factors

This shows, among other details, that the dataset consists of records from 37 
patients, aged 18 to 45, of whom 21 are female and 16 male. Looking further, you
may notice that patient identifier, which should be unique, has been imported 
as a factor - this is probably not the best option for a unique identifier so it 
would be best to convert this to character strings.


```r
tuberculosis$Patient_ID <- as.character(tuberculosis$Patient_ID)
str(tuberculosis$Patient_ID)
```

~~~
##  chr [1:37] "P25" "P28" "P17" "P27" "P5" "P6" "P7" "P26" "P34" "P36" "P11" ...
